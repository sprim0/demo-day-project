How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Passport.js, EJS, Bootstrap

Optimizations
During development, I modernized the codebase to work with the latest versions of Mongoose by refactoring all callback-based database queries to use async/await syntax. This not only resolved compatibility issues but also made the code more readable and easier to maintain. The promise-based approach reduces callback nesting and provides cleaner error handling with try/catch blocks.

Lessons Learned:
The biggest learning experience from this project was mastering EJS templating and understanding how to properly structure views in an Express application.
